      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        My approach to engineering design is deeply rooted in the values instilled in me by my upbringing and experiences:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Fairness and Kindness:</strong> These values, instilled by my parents, shape how I interact with my peers and collaborators. In group projects, I ensure that all voices are heard and that contributions are equally valued. Respect and inclusivity are integral to my work as an engineering designer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diligence and Commitment:</strong> Once I undertake a project, I am committed to delivering results of the highest quality. This diligence translates into a detail-oriented approach to engineering design. For instance, in a recent design report, I identified potential usability challenges—such as the issue of dripping in a novel bubble tea cup design—that were initially overlooked by my peers. My commitment to thoroughness ensures that feasibility and practicality remain at the forefront of my designs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Giving Back:</strong> Growing up with access to education, health, and family support has instilled in me a strong sense of gratitude and a desire to give back. Engineering design offers a pathway for me to contribute to society by creating solutions that improve lives.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
        These beliefs and values shape my perception of engineering design as a tool for societal benefit, collaboration, and innovation. They also inform my identity as a team player who values cooperation and mutual respect.
