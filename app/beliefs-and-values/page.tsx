      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        My approach to engineering design is deeply rooted in the values instilled in me by my upbringing and experiences:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Fairness and Kindness:</strong> I believe in fairness and kindness; values which were instilled in me by my parents. These values shape how I interact with my peers and collaborators. In engineering design group work, I ensure all group members are equally heard and valued.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diligence and Commitment:</strong> I believe in diligence. Once I start a project, especially those of engineering design, I am committed to delivering results of the highest quality. This diligence results in a detail-oriented approach to engineering design. For instance, in my design report, I identified potential usability challenges—such as the issue of dripping in a novel bubble tea cup design—that were initially overlooked by my peers. My commitment to thoroughness ensures that feasibility and practicality remain at the forefront of my designs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Giving Back:</strong> Growing up with access to education, good health, and loving family has instilled in me a strong sense of gratitude and a desire to give back. Engineering design offers a pathway for me to contribute to society by creating solutions that improve lives.
