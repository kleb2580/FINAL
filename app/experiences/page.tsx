                          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Exploration of Coding</h3>
                          <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Coding became a natural extension of my curiosity and desire to create. I began making fun low-level games which helped me gain an appreciation for the intersection of creativity and engineering.</p>

                          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Integrating Creativity into Engineering Design</h3>
                          <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">I began to consciously recognize my desire to combine my love for creative expression with engineering concepts through code. With this, I undertook creative coding projects, visually expressing various computer science and mathematical concepts. My introduction to engineering design was primarily in UI and web design, which I found particularly fulfilling because it combines functionality with visual expression.</p>
                          <p class="text-base font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">For example, in the aforementioned design report for a bubble tea cup, my creative background allowed me to explore unconventional solutions that went beyond the status quo.</p>
                      </li>
                  </ol>
      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
        These experiences have taught me to view engineering design as an inherently creative discipline. While it is often seen as objective and structured, my background helps me approach design challenges with out-of-the-box thinking and innovative ideas. For example, in the aforementioned design report for a bubble tea cup, my creative background allowed me to explore unconventional solutions that went beyond the status quo.
