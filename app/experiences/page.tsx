          <strong>Creative Foundations:</strong> As a child, I immersed myself in creative activities such as playing the violin and drawing. These experiences nurtured my creative thinking and appreciation for aesthetics.

          <strong>Independent Exploration of Coding:</strong> Coding became a natural extension of my curiosity and desire to create. Its low barrier to entry allowed me to experiment with real-world applications at an early stage. Through coding, I developed a strong appreciation for the intersection of creativity and engineering.

        <li>
          <strong>Integrating Creativity into Engineering Design:</strong> My creative interests influenced my pursuit of fields like creative coding, UI design, and web design. For example, I find UI and web design particularly fulfilling because they combine functionality with visual expressionâ€”a balance that mirrors the goals of engineering design.

        These experiences have taught me to view engineering design as an inherently creative discipline. While it is often seen as objective and structured, my background helps me approach design challenges with out-of-the-box thinking and innovative ideas. For example, in the aforementioned design report for a bubble tea cup, my creative background allowed me to explore unconventional solutions that went beyond the status quo.
